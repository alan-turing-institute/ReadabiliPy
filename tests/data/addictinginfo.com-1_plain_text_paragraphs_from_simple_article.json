["Donald Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) at his rallies, calling her Pochahontas to cast doubt on her Native American Heritage. Trump even referred to Warren as Pocahontas at a November 2017 White House event honoring Navajo code-breakers. At a rally in Montana this past July, Trump offered Sen. Warren $1 million if she took a DNA test to prove her heritage. Trump spoke of bringing a DNA test to a debate if she challenges him.",
"“We will take that little kit — but we have to do it gently. Because we’re in the #MeToo generation, we have to do it gently,” Trump said. “And we will very gently take that kit, and slowly toss it, hoping it doesn’t injure her arm, and we will say: I will give you a million dollars to your favorite charity, paid for by Trump, if you take the test and it shows you’re an Indian. I have a feeling she will say no.”",
"Today the Massachusetts Senator released her DNA results.",
"“The facts suggest that you absolutely have a Native American ancestor in your pedigree,” an Ancestry.com and 23andMe adviser told Warren.",
"Warren tweeted Trump to demand he pay what he promised and requested that he make the donation to the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center.",
"By the way, @realDonaldTrump: Remember saying on 7/5 that you’d give $1M to a charity of my choice if my DNA showed Native American ancestry? I remember – and here’s the verdict. Please send the check to the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center: https://t.co/I6YQ9hf7Tv pic.twitter.com/J4gBamaeeo",

"In response, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway called DNA testing “junk science.”",
"Then, Trump flat out denied ever promising to make that donation even though it’s on tape.",
"“Who cares?” Trump told reporters today. “I didn’t say that. Nope, you better read it again.”",
"Well, MSNBC has the receipts:",
"MSNBC put together video of Trump unequivocally telling Elizabeth Warren in July that “I’ll give you a million dollars, to your favorite charity, paid for by Trump, if you take [a DNA] test and it shows you’re an Indian” — followed by him denying he ever said that this morning. pic.twitter.com/zR3n2DqaiY",
